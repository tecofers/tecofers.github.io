### Introduction
As a Linux system administrator or power user, understanding detailed information about your system is critical for troubleshooting issues, monitoring performance, and general system management. Lucky for us, Linux provides some handy built-in commands to quickly get vital insights.

In this post, we will explore 10 must-know Linux commands for probing system details that every Linux user should have in their toolkit. With simple yet powerful utilities literally at your fingertips, you can grasp what’s happening “under the hood” of your Linux machine and utilize its resources optimally.

### Getting the Date and Time
The first command we will look at is date. As the name suggests, this prints out the current system date and time in an easy-to-read format:

    date
    Thu Dec 7 11:05:06 PST 2023

The date command is useful for scripting scheduled tasks or putting log file entries in context. Some additional formatting flags allow customizing the output.

### Checking System Uptime
To get a quick view of how long your system has been running since the last reboot, use the uptime command:

    uptime
    09:49:52 up  3:52,  1 user,  load average: 2.45, 1.97, 1.69

The output shows the current time, followed by the uptime, etc. Knowing system uptime helps determine if an issue may be caused by a recent reboot or update.

### Identifying Your user
The whoami command prints out your effective user identifier. This is important in determining what permissions you have for accessing files and running privileged commands:

If you need to carry out tasks requiring root access, use whoami to check if you are the super user account first.

Looking for a reliable and cost-effective VPS hosting solution? Hostinger VPS might be the perfect fit for your needs. With powerful features, scalable resources, and excellent customer support, Hostinger VPS ensures a smooth hosting experience for your projects.

### Checking Logged-In Users
To see all users currently logged into the system, utilize the w command:

    w
     11:10:01 up 2 days, 18:26,  1 user,  load average: 0.00, 0.01, 0.05
    USER     TTY      FROM             LOGIN@   IDLE   JCPU   PCPU WHAT
    john     tty7     :0               Wed09    2days  0.27s  0.27s -bash

This provides information like the login session, source terminal, login time, activity status, and current process for each active user. Helpful for monitoring remote access and production system use.

### Getting CPU Details
Dig into your system’s processor particulars with cat 

    /proc/cpuinfo:
    
    cat /proc/cpuinfo
    
    processor       : 0
    vendor_id       : GenuineIntel
    cpu family      : 6 
    model           : 60
    model name      : Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4720HQ CPU @ 2.60GHz  
    stepping        : 3
    cpu MHz         : 2594.084
    cache size      : 6144 KB
    physical id     : 0

This exposes the specifications of your CPU including model numbers, speeds, cache sizes, architecture features and more. Great reference for compatibility checking.

### Checking Memory Usage
The cat /proc/meminfo command dumps a comprehensive overview of current system memory utilization:

    cat /proc/meminfo
    
    MemTotal:        8191124 kB
    MemFree:         289396 kB
    MemAvailable:    6390952 kB 

Important metrics like total physical memory, free memory, buffered memory, and swap details are listed. Use this for identifying any memory bottlenecks.

### Displaying Memory and Swap Usage
For memory usage summarized in an easy-to-grasp format, free is the go-to:

                 total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
    Mem:        8191124     2437968      289396       93860     5250760     6390952
    Swap:       2097148           0     2097148

This indicates total, used and free memory as well as valuable swap usage. Helpful for correlating performance dips to memory pressure.

### Checking Disk Space by Directory
The du command is used to check disk usage for a specific directory:

    du -sh /home
    
    4.0K    /home/

By passing in the path to check as a parameter, it prints out the size in human readable format. Useful before writing backups or downloads to prevent filling up your disks.

### Seeing Filesystem Disk Space Usage
For a filesystem level overview, df delivers:

    Filesystem     1K-blocks    Used Available Use% Mounted on
    udev             240100       0    240100   0% /dev
    tmpfs             49892     140     49752   1% /run
    /dev/sda2      48767744 4881032  42035220  11% /

This displays disk space consumed and available across all mount points. Helps identify volumes at risk of running out of free space for scheduling expansion.

### Displaying Kernel Details
Last but not least, uname -a shows insightful kernel release information:

    uname -a    
    
    Linux localhost.localdomain 5.4.0-42-generic #46-Ubuntu SMP Fri Jul 10 00:24:02 UTC 2020 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux

Everything from host name, kernel name, version, architecture and build details in one command. Great for at-a-glance kernel environment info.
