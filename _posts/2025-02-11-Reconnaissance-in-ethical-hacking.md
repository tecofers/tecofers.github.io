Great! Let‚Äôs move on to the next phase of ethical hacking: **Reconnaissance**. This is where the real fun begins. Reconnaissance is all about gathering information about your target, and it‚Äôs the foundation of any successful hack. Whether you‚Äôre a beginner or an advanced user, mastering recon is crucial. Let‚Äôs dive in!

## **Introduction: Why Reconnaissance Is the First Step to Hacking**

Imagine you‚Äôre planning a heist (the legal, ethical kind, of course). You wouldn‚Äôt just bust into a bank without knowing where the vault is, right? The same goes for hacking. Before you can exploit a system, you need to understand it. That‚Äôs where reconnaissance comes in.  

Reconnaissance, or ‚Äúrecon,‚Äù is the process of gathering information about your target. It‚Äôs about finding weaknesses, understanding the environment, and planning your attack. Think of it as the detective work of hacking.  

In this lesson, we‚Äôll cover the basics of reconnaissance, the tools you‚Äôll use, and how to gather intel like a pro. By the end, you‚Äôll know how to find vulnerabilities before you even touch a system.

### **What Is Reconnaissance?**

Reconnaissance is the first phase of ethical hacking. It involves collecting as much information as possible about your target, including:  

- IP addresses  
- Domain names  
- Network topology  
- Open ports and services  
- Employee names and email addresses  
- Software versions and configurations  

The goal is to create a detailed map of the target‚Äôs environment. This map will guide your attack strategy and help you identify the best entry points.

### **Types of Reconnaissance**

There are two main types of reconnaissance:  

#### **1. Passive Reconnaissance**

Passive recon involves gathering information without directly interacting with the target. This means you‚Äôre not sending any packets or probing the system. Instead, you‚Äôre using publicly available information.  

Examples of passive recon include:  

- Searching Google for information about the target.  
- Checking social media profiles of employees.  
- Using tools like **Whois** to look up domain registration details.  

Passive recon is low-risk because it‚Äôs hard for the target to detect.  

#### **2. Active Reconnaissance**

Active recon involves directly interacting with the target to gather information. This could include scanning ports, pinging servers, or probing for vulnerabilities.  

Examples of active recon include:  

- Using **Nmap** to scan for open ports.  
- Running **Nikto** to scan for web vulnerabilities.  
- Sending crafted packets to see how the target responds.  

Active recon is riskier because it can trigger alarms or alerts on the target‚Äôs side.

### **Tools for Reconnaissance**

Now that you know the types of recon, let‚Äôs talk about the tools you‚Äôll use. Here are some of the best:  

#### **1. Nmap**

Nmap is the ultimate reconnaissance tool. It lets you scan networks, discover devices, and identify open ports and services.  

Example command:  

```bash
nmap -sV -O 192.168.1.1
```

This scans the target IP address, identifies services, and guesses the operating system.  

#### **2. Whois**

Whois is a tool for looking up domain registration details. It can tell you who owns a domain, when it was registered, and where it‚Äôs hosted.  

Example command:  

```bash
whois example.com
```

#### **3. theHarvester**

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be175cbd-9987-4fda-9c8c-198fc143a91c" alt="theHarvester" class="img">

theHarvester is a tool for gathering email addresses, subdomains, and other information from public sources.  

Example command:  

```bash
theHarvester -d example.com -b otx
```

This searches otx for information about `example.com`. Seriously, there are many search domains that can completely naked down your domain.

#### **4. Shodan**

Shodan is a search engine for internet-connected devices. It lets you find devices, servers, and services that are exposed to the internet. First, you need to create a account on their website. Then, after login you'll get an API key to use their serach filters.

Example search:  

```bash
city:"New York" port:22
```
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1ec0b82-11a5-4c52-9d70-e212a5a05c1d" alt="shodan" class="img">

This finds devices in New York with port 22 (SSH) open.  As you can see, it showing devices from top organizations and ssh products. Also, we can guess the OS.
To use the CLI-interface, first initialize Shodan using the api key:

```bash
$ shodan init sPOPq****nSCME7GG1***************oj8
```
Now, run the command:

```bash
$ shodan stats --facets port:80 country:US
```

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed78c056-6d05-4293-bd0a-e58b8c695e0e" alt="shodan-cli" class="img">


#### **5. Maltego**

Maltego is a powerful tool for visualizing relationships between people, domains, and networks. It‚Äôs great for mapping out a target‚Äôs environment. First, create an account on their website. Next, launch the application from the menu or command line:

```bash
$ maltego
```
Now, continue with the option of activation with ID. This will give you a browser link. Just use the option of activating with Maltego ID by clicking a browser link to authenticate. Please have some click-click play to complete the process.

### **Your Reconnaissance Challenge**

Ready to put your skills to the test? Here‚Äôs a hands-on challenge:  

1. Choose a target (make sure you have permission to test it!).  
2. Use **Whois** to look up domain registration details.  
3. Use **Nmap** to scan the target‚Äôs IP address and identify open ports.  
4. Use **theHarvester** to gather email addresses and subdomains.  
5. Use **Shodan** to find internet-connected devices related to the target.  

This exercise will give you a feel for how reconnaissance works and how much information you can gather without even touching the target.

### **What‚Äôs Next?**

In the next lesson, we‚Äôll dive into **scanning and enumeration**, the next phase of ethical hacking. This is where you‚Äôll take the information you gathered during recon and use it to probe the target for vulnerabilities.  

Remember, reconnaissance is the foundation of ethical hacking. The more information you gather, the better your chances of success. So take your time, be thorough, and always stay within legal boundaries.
