# **The Hidden Reality of Tech Job Hunting: A Senior Developer's Journey Through Uncertainty**

The tech industry often paints a picture of endless opportunities and sky-high salaries. But there's a reality that many don't talk about: the challenging, often demoralizing journey of job hunting in tech. Today, I want to share the story of  [John Thwaites](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zerk/) and the valuable lessons I've learned from this. I hope it helps others facing similar challenges.

## **Numbers Don't Lie**

Over the past year, his job search statistics tell a sobering story:

- 1000+ job applications submitted
- 5 interviews secured
- 0 job offers

These aren't just numbers; they represent countless hours of tailoring resumes, writing cover letters, and maintaining hope despite constant rejection.

## **The Paradox of Qualification**

One of the most frustrating paradoxes he encountered is being "overqualified." Even when attempting to secure temporary positions to support his family, he faced rejection because employers assume he won't stay long-term. This creates a catch-22: too qualified for some roles, yet unable to secure positions matching his experience level.

## **The Broken Technical Interview**

After 20+ years of programming experience (starting at age 11), he observed several concerning trends in tech hiring:

1. **Mismatched Interviewer Expertise**: Junior developers interviewing senior candidates
2. **Irrelevant Technical Assessments**: Questions focusing on trivia rather than practical problem-solving abilities
3. **Disconnect from Real-World Skills**: Interview processes that fail to evaluate actual job requirements

## **Lessons Learned and Tips for Fellow Job Seekers**

1. **Stay Resilient**: Despite rejections, maintain your professional development and keep your skills sharp
2. **Diversify Your Approach**: Consider entrepreneurship or freelancing as alternative paths
3. **Be Honest About Struggles**: Share your experiences - it helps others feel less alone
4. **Network Actively**: Sometimes opportunities come through unexpected connections

## **A Call for Change in Tech Hiring**

The tech industry needs to revolutionize its hiring practices:

- Focus on practical skills over memorized knowledge
- Implement more relevant assessment methods
- Consider potential and passion alongside experience
- Create more inclusive and understanding interview processes

## **Moving Forward**

While this journey has been challenging, especially with a family depending on him, it's also been enlightening. It's revealed the need for change in tech hiring practices and the importance of supporting each other through difficult times.

## **Final Thoughts**

If you're struggling in your tech job search, remember: you're not alone. There are many whose circumstances resemble [John Thwaites](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zerk/). Remember, your worth isn't determined by your employment status. Keep pushing forward, keep learning, and keep supporting others in similar situations.
