# I Almost Fell for a Job Scam — Here's What Happened

It started just like any other day.  

Two days ago, I got a random message on **Telegram** from someone named *Anuja*. She said she was a recruiter from **AJIO**, which is a popular company owned by Reliance.

She was polite, professional, and seemed legit.  
She offered me a **work-from-home, part-time job** as a **Quality Analyst**.

The job sounded super simple:  
Just help merchants by placing fake “virtual orders” to boost their sales.

She sent me a link to a website called **ajio.global**.  
It looked clean and professional — almost like the real AJIO site.

Then came the best part.  
They gave me a **trial bonus** and asked me to complete some basic tasks.

So, I clicked around, did 25 “tasks,” and after a while, they said I could withdraw my **commission**.

Guess what?  
A small amount of **real money** landed in my bank account. 💸

It was shocking.  
The money was real.  
And that’s the trap.

They invest a small amount in you. Just enough to make you trust them.

Right after that, they added a **“welcome bonus”** to my account.  
But I couldn’t withdraw it unless I completed the next round of tasks.

Here’s the catch:  
I had to **add my own money** to unlock the new tasks.

That’s when I knew something was very wrong.  
I searched online and found out the truth:

> This was a **scam** — and the real AJIO had nothing to do with it.

It’s called a **Task Scam**.  
They promise easy money, show you small results, and then trick you into putting in your own money — which you may never get back.

## 🚨 Watch out for these red flags:

- Job offers that come out of nowhere (Telegram or WhatsApp)  
- Vague job roles like “task helper” or “boost sales”  
- Websites that *look* real but aren’t  
- A small payment upfront to build trust  
- Requests to deposit your own money to earn more

## Final Thoughts

Not every job offer is real.  
Some are carefully planned scams.

If something feels off, **listen to your gut**.  
And remember:  
**No real company will ever ask you to pay to work.**

I’m lucky I didn’t lose any money.  
But many people do.

Please share this story. It might help someone avoid the trap. 🙏
